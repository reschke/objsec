1.  Introduction

   In the last decade, the generalization of network access, the cloud
   and the ubiquity of the web as an application platform has translated
   into an unprecedented increase in the use of the Internet,
   facilitated by the development of new web standards and the
   innovations in mobile technologies.  With this growth in use, there
   has been an increased amount of personal data being sent over multi
   hop public links.

   In order to protect the integrity and confidentiality of the online
   transactions, http traffic can be secured with transport layer
   security using https.  While https is great for e-commerce and
   banking and while there is a sense of understanding in the user
   community around the secure nature of https, using TLS and https for
   the majority of the traffic has performance and functional drawbacks,
   mainly because the http session is encrypted as a whole.

   Looking from the privacy and security perspective, it is clear that
   users must be aware if and when an intermediary node is intercepting
   their traffic and they have the right to continue or demand higher
   levels of privacy by encrypting what they deem to be sensitive
   information.  The privacy threshold depends on user's tolerance and
   the trust they put in the intermediary's reputation.

   Modern web architecture involves sophisticated caching schemes that
   involve fetching various objects (images, libraries, etc.) from
   various locations in the path to avoid latency and improve the
   overall user experience while reducing bandwidth use.  This is an
   important aspect especially in the developing countries, remote
   locations and in general areas that lack fast network infrastructure.

   The ability to atomically encrypt objects or even http frames should
   support this sophisticated caching mechanisms while allowing content
   providers to avoid distributing their server key material across the
   network nodes and prevent the risk of compromising their security.

2.  Benefits for the content provider, for the users, for the
    intermediaries

   An object security approach will allow the different parties to
   establis end-to-end and hop-by-hop security mechanisms to different
   data and metadata elements, and therefore address what can be seen as
   conflicting requirements in terms of optimization and security
   capabilitites.

   The following benefits will arise for the different stakeholders:

   Content providers:

   o  Can select the type of security service that is optimal and
      sufficient for particular types of content: e.g. confidentiality,
      integrity protection, entity authentication etc.

   o  Can select which parts of their content shall be secured or not
      and how content shall be securely retrievable.

   o  Can increase their confidence in secure temporary content storage
      during delivery through encrypting/signing sensitive content
      objects.

   o  Can leverage the business services of 3rd parties (intermediaries)
      through enabling the intermediaries to perform value-added
      services.  Content providers may outsource particular tasks (like
      caching, or offering higher security level to users) to
      intermediaries.

   o  When using the services of content delivery networks can benefit
      from faster, optimised delivery over the "last mile" (as seen from
      the perspective of a content delivery network).  Content delivery
      networks can optimise delivery on behalf of content providers over
      the first and middle mile, however they often rely on other ISPs
      and mobile network operators to deliver content over the last
      mile.  Intermediaries in the last mile can optimise traffic
      engineering.

   Users:

   o  Are able to enjoy sufficient privacy and security as dictated by
      different use cases and equally their personal preferences (e.g.
      protection from traffic analysis, integrity of content).

   o  Can benefit from value-added services delivered by intermediaries
      on behalf of content providers.

   o  Can have access to services offered by intermediaries which
      enhance end user quality of experience (e.g. malware detection,
      parental controls).

   o  Can access web resources and services with lower latency and
      better response times (e.g. through intermediaries performing
      video pacing or traffic engineering to avoid congestion on
      particular networks).

   Intermediaries:

   o  Can play their specific roles in content delivery and
      communication on behalf of content providers, like

      *  Caching of content on behalf of content providers

      *  Optimisation of content for optimal delivery on behalf of
         content providers

      *  Video pacing on behalf of content providers.

   o  Can provide value-added services on behalf of users like URL
      filtering , parental control, malware detection etc.

   o  Can optimise content delivery and data communication within a
      network they are associated with or control e.g. through traffic
      engineering and traffic management by taking into account the
      inherent needs of content types and the explicit real- and non-
      real-time requirements of content providers and content delivery
      networks.  Thereby, intermediaries contribute to an improved "end-
      to-end" user experience in the interest of both users and content
      providers.

      *  Intermediaries are enabled to perform congestion management and
         can therefore reduce latency and response times.

   o  Can meet regulatory requirements as they may prevail in particular
      jurisdictions through an approach which is more open and
      transparent to both users and content providers, and which may be
      in the national interest.

3.  Analysis of related work

   The concept of object security is not something new, several
   approaches targeted at different application areas exist today.

3.1.  JOSE

   JOSE stands for "JSON Object Signing and Encryption".  It is a series
   of standards produced by the IETF under the JOSE charter
   (<https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/charter/>).
